I saw some neat JavaScript projects using the audio html DOM element to make a drum machine and I thought that is way too useful.  You know what is less useful and a little fun?  A button that plays the joke drum lick!  So let's go ahead and create that.

### [](#Joke Drum Lick)Joke Drum Lick

Using the audio DOM element lets make a button that when clicked plays 3 sounds synchronously.

> Click a button and have it play 3 sounds one after another.

The first step is to setup the [project](https://github.com/Robooto/joke-sound)


```js
<audio data-key="74" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Robooto/joke-sound/main/sounds/snare.wav"></audio>
<audio data-key="69" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Robooto/joke-sound/main/sounds/crash.wav"></audio>
<div class="center">
    <button id="play">A Hilarious Joke Happened!</button>
</div>

const play = document.querySelector('#play');
play.addEventListener('click', () => {
    const snare = document.querySelector(`audio[data-key="74"]`);
    snare.play();
    snare.play();
    
    const crash = document.querySelector(`audio[data-key="69"]`);
    crash.play();
});
```

Well this plays all the sounds but not one after each other.  Luckily the [audio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio) element has an onended event that is triggered once the sound is done.

There are a couple directions we could go and they differ a bit so let's explore them both!

#### [](#Use-Promises) Use Promises

[Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) represent the eventual completion of an operation so we'll set the onended event to resolve the promise.

```js
<audio data-key="74" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Robooto/joke-sound/main/sounds/snare.wav"></audio>
<audio data-key="69" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Robooto/joke-sound/main/sounds/crash.wav"></audio>
<div class="center">
    <button id="play">A Hilarious Joke Happened!</button>
</div>

const play = document.querySelector('#play');
play.addEventListener('click', () => {
    audioPromise(74).then(() => audioPromise(74).then(() => audioPromise(69)));
});

function audioPromise(keyCode) {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        const audio = document.querySelector(`audio[data-key="${keyCode}"]`);
        audio.currentTime = 0;
        audio.onended = resolve;
        audio.play();
    });
}
```

Now since we are using promises the next sound doesn't play till after the first sound ends.  This works!  The only problem is I don't really like how it reads.  The nested promises are a little hard to understand in my opinion.

#### [](#Use-Recursion) Use Recursion

Recursion is a scary word that can land you into some trouble but in this case we can write a function that plays a sound then on the onended event it will call the same function.

```js
<audio data-key="74" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Robooto/joke-sound/main/sounds/snare.wav"></audio>
<audio data-key="69" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Robooto/joke-sound/main/sounds/crash.wav"></audio>
<div class="center">
    <button id="play">A Hilarious Joke Happened!</button>
</div>

const play = document.querySelector('#play');
play.addEventListener("click", () => playAudioSync([74, 74, 69], 0));

function playAudioSync(array, index) {
  if (!array[index]) {
    return;
  }

  const audio = document.querySelector(`audio[data-key="${array[index]}"]`);
  audio.currentTime = 0;
  audio.onended = () => playAudioSync(array, index + 1);
  audio.play();
}
```

This works great and it doesn't have the readability issues.  While technically it is a few more lines of code than the promise way but I think this is a bit easier to digest.

This works by passing in an array of sounds then every time the onended happens the function is called again but we move through the array.

Try out either way and Happy Coding!
